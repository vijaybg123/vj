## Project Motivation <a name="Project_Motivation"></a>

This the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program Project.
For this Project, i am using Stack Overflow data from 2018 and 2019 to answer:</br>
    1. Which are the most used programming languages around the world in 2018 and 2019?</br>
    2. Which are the most uded programming languages in the United States?</br>
    3. Career satisfaction in United States in 2018 and 2019.</br>
    
## File Description <a name="Files"></a>

**Write a Data Scientist Blog Post.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis to answer the questions in Project motivation.</br>
